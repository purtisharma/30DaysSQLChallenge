Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name. If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.

SELECT Name
FROM STUDENTS
WHERE Marks > 75
ORDER BY RIGHT(Name, 3), ID;

--Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with  sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with  sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

SELECT CASE
WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
ELSE 'Scalene'
END
